# 👋 Hi, I’m @AltafShekali

- 👀 I’m deeply interested in **Web Development, App Development, and AI-based Projects**.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Machine Learning, Agentic AI, and Full-Stack App Development**.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
  - AI-powered tools like chatbots, scam detectors, and personal assistants
  - Web platforms that solve real-world problems (e.g. subscription systems, hiring platforms)
  - Open-source education or productivity tools for students
- 📫 How to reach me: **altafshekali16@gmail.com**  
- 😄 Pronouns: **He/Him**
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m building a Smart StudyBot+ that can chat with technical PDFs, help students by semester/branch, and give teachers analytics — powered by RAG and Ollama!
